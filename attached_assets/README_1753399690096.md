# nomi-tools
List and chat with Nomi's.

This is a simple python script that enables you to list and/or chat with your nomi's.
It has some basic color formatting options that allow you to change the text colors used
in the menu, nomi chat, self chat and error messages.

You will need to replace the API_KEY = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" in the nomi_tools.py file 
with your own API key from your nomi.ai profile.
